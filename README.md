# Classifying Toxic Comments on the Jigsaw Toxic Comment Dataset

This project analyzes the [Toxic Comment Classification Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge) to predict the toxicity of comments based off Wikipedia comments that have been labeled for toxic behavior.

You may consult `report.pdf` for more information. If you wish to run the tests described in the document, refer to the "Installation and Running" section below.

## Installation and Running

Assuming you have Python installed:

1. On a command prompt or Powershell, clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/gustavolp1/games-recommendation-api
```

2. Switch the directory to the newly-cloned repository:

```
cd games-recommendation-api
```

3. (Recommended) Create a virtual environment and activate it:

```
python -m venv env
.\env\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

4. Install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r "requirements.txt"
```

5. Open `process.ipynb` in a Python Notebook editor. If prompted, select your kernel as "env" (or your selected environment name). You may now run each cell as you desire.
